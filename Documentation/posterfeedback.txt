Hi, Thomas ~~~~

Great job on this!  I love the color, the graphics, and the layout.  Just a couple of suggestions:

1. you still have the "CMSI 401" banner with the original names.  I'd think
      Andrew *migh* want his name on there, too....
2. the second sentence under "The Algorithm" is a bit awkward.
   is:
      ...to apply learned weights to each variable and outputs most likely winner.
   should be:
      ...to apply learned weights to each variable and output the most likely winner

Other than that, it looks wonderful!  Make sure that a copy is in your repo.

Regards,
Dr. Johnson
